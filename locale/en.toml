If the user only wants to keep a small subset of the tags provided by MusicBrainz, they can specify only the tags that they want to keep rather than develop a lengthy tagger script to remove all of the tags that they don't want.\n\nTags that you wish to keep are entered in a page in the options settings, with each tag on a separate line. Blank lines will be ignored. The entries are not case-sensitive.\n\nIf a tag in the list ends with an asterisk (`*`), then it will keep any tags beginning with the tag. For example, if your list contains \"`performer:*`\" then all tags beginning with \"`performer:`\" will be kept, such as \"`performer:instrument`\" and \"`performer:vocals`\".\n\nAll tags that are removed will still be available as variables with \"`_ko_`\" prepended to the tag name. For example, if you choose not to keep the \"`musicbrainz_trackid`\" tag, it will still be available to scripts as \"`%_ko_musicbrainz_trackid%`\"."
